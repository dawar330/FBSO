      "It's safe to say that the average home buyer buys every 13 years, but there are owners and home sellers who sell every two or three years.",

      "On the vendor side, we provide free basic products that provide the majority of the utilities provided by rivals. We charge for the right to close the remaining four stages. The initial investment is $399, with a performance fee of $699.",
